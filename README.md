# Statistical Tests Distribution Tables Guide

Quick guide for determining which distribution tables to use for common statistical tests based on sample size.

## 📊 What is this?

This repository provides a clear, organized reference for students, researchers, and data analysts who need to know:

- Which statistical distribution tables to use for different tests
- When to switch between distribution tables based on sample size
- The relationship between exact distributions and their large-sample approximations

## 🎯 Why is this useful?

When conducting statistical tests, you often need to look up critical values from distribution tables. However, many tests can use **different distribution tables depending on your sample size**:

- **Small samples** → Use exact distribution tables (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis tables)
- **Large samples** → Use approximation tables (e.g., Chi-square distribution)

This guide eliminates confusion by clearly showing the cutoff points and which table to use when.

## 📋 What's included?

### Covered Statistical Tests:

**Non-Parametric Tests:**
- Kruskal-Wallis Test
- Friedman Test
- Mann-Whitney U Test
- Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
- Spearman's Rank Correlation

**Parametric Tests:**
- Independent Samples t-test
- Paired Samples t-test
- One-Way ANOVA (F-test)
- Chi-Square Test of Independence
- Pearson Correlation Coefficient

### For each test, you'll find:
✅ Sample size thresholds  
✅ Which distribution table to use  
✅ Degrees of freedom calculations  
✅ Important notes and special cases

## 🚀 How to use this guide

1. **Identify your statistical test** (e.g., Mann-Whitney U test)
2. **Check your sample size** (e.g., n₁ = 15, n₂ = 18)
3. **Look up the appropriate distribution table** from the reference
4. **Use the correct table** to find your critical value or p-value
